# DocWise 
A web application that aims to showcase all the data and statistics from a health monitoring smartwatch. The app shows the authenticated user the data about their temperature, O2 levels and pulse. Also, it shows multiple statistics that can be downloaded. 
Moreover, the users can log in their symptoms throughout the day to refer to them in the future (e.g. for a doctor's appointment)
